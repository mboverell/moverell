I started learning piano the year I turned 40.

I’d played guitar as a teenager, but hadn’t really improved in years—and never learned systematically. I wanted to try something completely new, with beginner’s mind. To see how I learn best. And to build a deeply human skill I can practice for decades (after the robots take over).

This is a personal logbook of that journey. Each of these recordings took weeks of energy, at least. They’re not polished, and I’ll probably cringe looking back. But I’m pushing myself to ship, reflect, and keep getting better with each project.

If any of this connects, I’d love to hear from you.

## Ode / Nils Frahm
- **Why I chose this song:** for the beautiful, unexpected chord voicing, and because I’ve always loved how Nils plays it live.
- **When I started:** December 2024, working on it for 2 months.
- **What made it challenging:** I don’t read sheet music, so had to transcribe it from YouTube videos and ear.
- This version recorded: June 2025 (after upgrading my keyboard).

## Avril 14th / Aphex Twin
- **Why I chose this song:** I’d always loved the melody, timing, and juxtaposition of each section.
- **When I started:** July 2024, and worked on it until November.
- **What made it challenging:** It was my first real attempt at playing independent left/right hands—a big leap for me at the time.
- This version recorded: June 2025 (after upgrading my keyboard).
