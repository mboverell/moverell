The energy is palpable. 100+ sleep-deprived participants, with overworked laptops, have seriously raised the temperature in the new Fishburners events space. Extra fans were acquired. Lunch has been served, and pitching practice has begun.

<a href="http://sydney.startupweekend.org/" title="Sydney Startup Weekend" target="_blank">Sydney Startup Weekend</a> kicked off last night, and we&rsquo;re right in the thick of it. A dozen ideas are being fleshed out, validated and developed. The goal for Sunday night is a compelling pitch, ideally with a working prototype. Bonus points for paying customers.

This is my first Startup Weekend. I&rsquo;m not directly participating, but involved as a panelist/mentor. A few early observations:<!-- more -->

**The marketplace for ideas is brutal. ** Friday night saw 50 x 1 minute pitches. Less than 20 would survive. I loved some. Too many didn&rsquo;t solve real problems. Comedy was a winner &#8211; anything to differentiate from the 49 others.

**There&rsquo;s a severe drought of technical talent. ** Almost every pitcher was looking for technical + design talent. As a non-coder, I can&rsquo;t talk. But the mis-match was obvious. One of the top pitchers won an iPad. He immediately offered it to any technical lead in the room who&rsquo;d sign up to work with him for the weekend.

**A concept can develop with amazing speed.  **Within 12 hours we saw landing pages, results from customer surveys, and in some cases even commitments from customers to sign up and purchase. It&rsquo;s a fascinating microcosm of the lean startup process. And a real lesson into how quickly and cheaply many startup concepts can be validated and developed.

I can see huge value in how the event brings together like minded people for a period of intense networking and working. People are connecting, having fun, and pushing boundaries. I&rsquo;ll be really intrigued to see if any of the teams and ideas last beyond Sunday night. 

There&rsquo;s clearly a precedent: my friend Matt Ho won the first event in Melbourne last year, with <a href="http://mandarinmadness.com/" title="Mandarin Madness" target="_blank">Mandarin Madness</a>. They&rsquo;ve worked hard together since then, now they&rsquo;ve had tens of thousands of downloads.

But the reality of starting a business is hard. Really, really hard.

It&rsquo;s fantastic that the startup process is becoming more widespread, accessible and lower cost. That&rsquo;s great for society as a whole, and the individuals who get involved. But it&rsquo;s not glamorous, and rarely sexy. Instagram is a 0.0000001% event.

I&rsquo;ll be doing my best to share both the excitement and reality of startup life over the weekend. 

How would you think about striking that balance?
