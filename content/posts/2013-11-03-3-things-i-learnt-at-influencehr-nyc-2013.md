I was in NYC last week, for the second <a title="InfluenceHR" href="http://influencehr.com/" target="_blank">InfluenceHR</a> Event. I missed the first, in San Francisco earlier this year. Which I now regret.

It was a top-quality event. Hyper focused on ‘Tech companies marketing to the HR buyer’, with content tailored exclusively towards that market. No schedule-fillers here. The content was engaging, and highly targeted.

This was also reflected in the quality of the audience: startup founders, CEOs, Heads of Marketing and HR, and industry leaders such as Bill Kutik.

I’ll be attending the next one for sure.

Along with some great conversations and connections, I took away 3 lessons about marketing HR products in 2013-14.<!-- more -->

## 1. Content is king, but context is queen.

Content marketing is a buzzword of 2012-13 (up there with &#8216;growth hacker’). But the bar for quality content is rising. And it’s increasingly critical for your content to be relevant to your customer’s **context**.

Context is everything you can infer about your customer, or things they’ve specifically told you, including:

  * Screen size (desktop, mobile or tablet)
  * Location
  * Interests and preferences (what has past behaviour indicated?)
  * Stage of purchase cycle (researching vs ready to buy)

Responsive web design is just one example of relevant context. <a title="Mike Volpe - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/mvolpe" target="_blank">Mike Volpe</a> (CMO at Hubspot) used other examples of how content could (or should!) be tailored specifically to an individual user. He was researching a new car recently, and invested serious time customising a model for a detailed online quote. The next time he visited that website, the car-marker missed a crucial opportunity, by promoting models that were completely outside his preferences.

## 2. Advocacy Marketing is fuel for your content marketing fire.

Smart companies are increasingly empowering &#8216;advocates’ to do marketing for them. Advocates could be engaged employees, customers or other &#8216;promoters’ outside the company. Examples of advocacy marketing include the <insertcompanyhere>Con events gaining popularity across the tech space.

The idea is that somewhat independent advocates will always be more convincing and compelling that company-endorsed marketing messages.

New startups are even emerging to help bring structure to these efforts. <a title="Mark Organ - Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/markorgan" target="_blank">Mark Organ</a> (founder of Eloqua, sold to Oracle) is now building a startup called <a title="Influitive" href="http://influitive.com/" target="_blank">Influitive</a>. It’s an interesting product that and allows companies to reward and incentivise advocates around specific challenges.

Watch this space.

## 3. HR &#8216;buyers’ are human, like everyone else.

> _Well done Mike. Super insight here._

(says the discerning reader).

But marketers &#8211; across all industries &#8211; consistently forget they’re communicating with people, not just cheque-books.

A panel of HR Buyers made it clear this forgetfulness is chronic among HR and Recruitment vendors.

Need evidence you’re dealing with real people?

> _I’ll buy from the salesperson I like most._
> 
> _If you don’t demonstrate you understand my problems in the first 5 minutes, you’re out._
> 
> _I need honesty. Don’t pretend to be something you’re not._
> 
> _It’s about relationship. I don’t want to be another client number._
> 
> _I’ll forgive mistakes if you show me you care._

Most of this is just &#8216;Consultative Sales 101’. But it’s painfully obvious too many marketers and salespeople throw common sense out the window in the hunt for quarterly targets.

<a title="InfluenceHR" href="http://influencehr.com/" target="_blank">InfluenceHR</a>: Hyper-focused content. Top-notch audience. And a great venue. This event will quickly become a must-attend event on the HR calendar.

See you there next year.
