Last week I shared <a title="The recruiter honeypot - best recruitment article I have read" href="http://recruitloop.com.au/blog/the-recruiter-honeypot-the-best-recruitment-post-ive-read/" target="_blank">the best recruitment article I’ve ever read</a>, which documented the ethical deficiencies of many agency recruiters with damning, real evidence. A classic honeypot.

One of the big issues was the repeated examples of recruiters poaching staff from the very company they were trying to work with. Poor form, and a practice that contributes massively to the cynicism and mistrust many people hold towards the recruitment industry.

So I was blown away when I saw a <a title="Twitter update" href="https://twitter.com/recguruoz/statuses/219756454918373376" target="_blank">tweet</a> yesterday, referencing an article from last month with some chest-beating from an agency recruiter about this exact practice: ‘_<a title="The Written Reference - When is a client not a client" href="http://thewrittenreference.com/2012/05/02/when-is-a-client-not-a-client/" target="_blank">When is a client not a client?</a>_’

<a title="Luke Collard" href="http://thewrittenreference.com/about-us/" target="_blank">The author</a> is a ‘passionate recruiter’ who despises ‘the cowboy recruiters who give the industry a bad name’. That’s a good start.

But this post is a brazen ‘you’re either with me or against me’ statement to justify when and how he draws the line between real clients, and ‘fair game’ for poaching staff.

As he says:

> _Companies in my marketplace broadly fall into two categories. I will either be working with them (i.e. a client), or they are a source of candidates._

Fair enough, perhaps. But then how to decide who’s a bona-fide client, and just some bozo who may have paid me once but isn’t a current favourite?

> _It is not just because they have called out of the blue and given me a job spec to work on, especially on a contingent basis. Similarly, just because we did some business together  at some point in the past, it doesn’t necessarily make them a client today. And they are definitely, absolutely and categorically not a client if  terms and fees have not been agreed and signed._

And in case there was any confusion…<!-- more -->

> _The reality is that unless we have agreed to terms, have them signed and are working together, or at least speaking, on a regular basis then you are not a client. Sure, we can change that if it suits us both. But until then, if I do place one of your staff elsewhere, ….sorry, it is not my problem._

Now, I’ve met Luke and he seems like a pretty nice guy. This is nothing personal. But it does feel like he’s opened hunting season on anyone who’s not currently paying a bill. I’d go further and argue it’s exactly the type of attitude that ‘gives the industry a bad name’.

**What’s wrong with this, specifically?**

Well, let’s imagine a few examples:

_You’re a small company who only hires 1-2 people a year. You work with a recruiter on one of the roles, but 6 months later get a great personal referral for the other hire. _

**→ Not currently hiring? Not A Client. Fair Game.**

_You use recruiters for senior management roles, but recruit entry-level roles internally. A recruiter gets to know your management team while placing a role. But you go a few months without any movement at the top. _

**→ No executive movement? Not A Client. Fair Game.**

_One of your best staff moves interstate so needs to find a new role. You refer them to a recruiter, who helps them find work (and picks up a hefty fee in the process). That recruiter picked up some juicy insights about your company from the departing employee._

**→ Just did a favour? Not A Client. Fair Game.**

To be clear, _**Fair Game**_ means everything you’ve shared with a recruiter, all the connections they’ve made with your business and staff, will now be used to poach them for other roles.

I know for a fact not all recruiters would take this approach. But the actions of a few easily ‘tarnish everyone with the same brush’.

And you wonder why people don’t trust traditional recruiters.
