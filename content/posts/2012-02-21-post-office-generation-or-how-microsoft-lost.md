An interesting article on minimalmac about the declining relevance of Microsoft Office:

<a class="tumblr_blog" href="http://minimalmac.com/post/17758177061/microsofts-biggest-miss" target="_blank">minimalmac</a>:

> Microsoft for many years had convinced the world that, in order to get “real work” done, you needed Office.  

Techcrunch follows it up with an article about the &rsquo;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/20/the-post-office-generation/?grcc=88888Z0" title="Techcrunch" target="_blank">Post Office Generation</a>&rsquo;:

> However, with the rise of tablets, office workers have suddenly noticed that they don’t need Office anymore. All they need is an email app, a notepad, and something like Dropbox. You can open Office docs on any device, you can edit text on nearly any tablet, and $9.99 gets you a capable word processor on the iPad. In short, Office is becoming irrelevant.

While Office is clearly a long way from dead for anyone working in a large corporate, I&rsquo;ve seen first hand how this is changing for people who don&rsquo;t. I spent years living in powerpoint, excel and word. Add Lotus Notes in the mix, and that would cover 99% of my non-browsing work time.

Now, my app-stack is completely transformed. My top 3:

  * GoogleDocs have changed my life. Probably my favourite collaboration app. Unfortunately, the big weakness is still in spreadsheets &#8211; it&rsquo;s well behind excel for any semi-remote power use.
  * Dropbox stores all files. Combined with googledocs, emailing documents is (or should be) a thing of the past.
  * Evernote keeps all notes, clips, sounds.

I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write a separate post on the app-stack for a corporate warrior vs an entrepreneur. That covers my favourites, but leaves a long tail of genius plugins and applications that make work/life at a startup so much more productive and fun.

Office may not be dead, but I can&rsquo;t see myself ever willingly going back to it.
