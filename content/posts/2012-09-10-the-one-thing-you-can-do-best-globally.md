I’ve heard this sentiment expressed in different ways for startups.

“<a title="Betashop" href="http://betashop.com/post/4066229168/the-only-question-your-startup-needs-to-answer-whats" target="_blank">Find your one thing</a>”

“<a title="Pollenizer" href="http://pollenizer.com/aarrr-focus-me-hearties" target="_blank">Focus</a>”

“<a title="One metric that matters" href="http://leananalyticsbook.com/one-metric-that-matters/" target="_blank">The OMTM</a>” (one metric that matters).

At <a title="Sydstart" href="http://www.sydstart.com/" target="_blank">SydStart</a> today (Sydney’s biggest startup event), it was repeated in a way that somehow stuck with me:

> Find the one thing you can be the best at globally. _Make sure everyone on your team fully believes it._ Then pursue it at the expense of anything else.  &#8211; <a title="Dominic O'Hanlon" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicohanlon" target="_blank">Dominic O&#8217;Hanlon</a>

Thinking about it this way just raises the bar.

A startup may have found its ‘one thing’, but if a dozen other companies can do the same or better, it’ll never make a dent.
