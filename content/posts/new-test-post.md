## In the beginning
There was a number of things we asked each person to do.

We created a list:

  * the first things
  * the second thing
  * the last thing.

**Then we picked the favourite thing.**

 I wonder what to make of the blah blah blah.

What about a numbered list?

  1. Do Something
  2. Do another thing.
  3. Do it again.

OK. So I see how the formatting works a little now.

> Do you really? Like Really?

It is super cool to hit save, then see the content directly in the site. But how different is that really to a preview in Wordpress??

### Do another heading
Just to make your point clear.

#### Can we do another one?
Just to check out the header styles.
