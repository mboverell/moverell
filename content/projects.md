> Things I’ve invested energy into at different times—for learning, meaning, or fun.

## Active
**The New Literacies**
A personal project to explore how to help my kids grow up ready for a world shaped by AI. Focused on the things school doesn’t cover. I’m testing things at home, and sharing what seems to have value.

**Music**
I started learning piano in 2024. These are recordings of a few pieces I invested more than a month in learning. Mostly late at night, for the joy of progress and sharing with other people.

**Angel Investing**
I’ve backed 15 early-stage companies, mostly founders from outside the US trying to break in. I slowed down after having our 3rd kid, but aiming to keep a steady pace of 2-3 a year—only where I can be useful in some way.

## Previous
**Antipodes (2021-2023)**
An investing syndicate I started with some impressive friends, to back foreign founders looking to crack the US. We invested $25K-$200K in 6 companies—all still active—alongside the best investors in ANZ. Currently on hold.

**Sweat & Shiver (2022-2023)**
A community project—sauna, ice bath, workouts with friends in my garage gym (another project). Mostly an excuse to invest more energy with people I enjoy and respect.

**BWR (2022)**
Trained for the Belgian Waffle Ride—a brutal, beautiful endurance event on gravel, dirt, and tarmac (+200km). Harder than expected, and exactly the kind of challenge I needed at the time.

**Baum (2025, 2020)**
A custom titanium bike, from Australia’s best builder (Darren Baum). Designed to be the only bike I’ll ever need. Now on its second iteration, after an accident in 2024. Same frame, new color.

**Founder Journey: RecruitLoop (2011-2017)**
Started a company in my twenties. Raised a seed round, moved to SF, built to profitability, and exited modestly (read: small f-failure). Formative in every sense. It got me to California, connected me to some great people, taught me a lot about hard things.

**Real Jim Courier (~2012)**
A parody tennis account I ran with a couple friends—before fake Twitter was cool. Served up back-hand insults and way-too-specific tennis takes. Somehow got traction, including a reply from the sitting Australian PM.

**Consulting: Australian NBN Project (2009)**
Worked on the national broadband rollout strategy—fiber, satellite, competition, pricing. Learned a ton about telco economics and how infrastructure shapes opportunity. Also the first time I realized most of the value lives at the application layer. That project pushed me toward tech.

**Honours Thesis (2007)**
One of my early career forks. I turned down a $30K PwC offer in Brisbane to do an extra year at uni and bet on something bigger. Wrote my thesis on corporate environmental reporting, got two papers published, and landed a role at McKinsey in Sydney.

**Henry Hiace (2005-2008)**
A 1990 Toyota campervan I drove across Australia with my girlfriend (now wife). We lived on $25 a day, used paper maps, and saw some unforgettable parts of the country. Then sold it for a profit.
