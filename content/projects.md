> Things I’ve invested energy into at different times—for learning, meaning, or fun.

## /Active

**New Literacies**

Exploring how to help kids thrive in a world shaped by AI—starting with my own. Focused on skills, ideas, and experiences they won’t get in school. Mostly experiments at home, and sharing what works.

**Music**

I started learning piano in 2024, with a 5-year goal to become a decent amateur. It’s mostly late-night practice, once kids are in bed. It feels scary sharing any of this progress, but I’m [doing it here](/music) to force myself to ship.

**Angel Investing**

I love supporting early-stage founders—especially outsiders with global ambition. I’ve backed 15+ companies so far. Slowed the pace after having our 3rd kid, and only invest when I can be unusually helpful. Aim for 2-3 new investments a year. 

## /Previous
**Antipodes (2021-2023)**

An investing syndicate I started with [some impressive friends](http://antipodes.vc/team), to back foreign founders looking to crack the US. We invested in 6 companies, with checks ranging from $25K-$250K—alongside the best investors in ANZ. Currently on hold.

**Sweat & Shiver (2022-2023)**

A community project—sauna, ice bath, workouts with friends in my garage gym (a parallel project!). Mostly an excuse to invest more energy with people I enjoy and respect.

**Belgian Waffle Ride (2022)**

Trained for the Belgian Waffle Ride—a brutal, beautiful endurance event on gravel, dirt, and tarmac (+200km) in Southern California. Finished in 11hrs, after a few solid months of training.

**Baum (2020)**

A custom titanium bike, from Australia’s best builder (Darren Baum). The [first version](https://www.flickr.com/photos/baumcycles/albums/72177720295946088/with/51820067660) was a labour of love, designed to be the only bike I’ll ever need. Now on its second iteration after an accident in 2024—same frame, new colors (coming soon).

**Founder Journey: RecruitLoop (2011-2017)**

Started a company in my twenties. Raised a seed round, moved to SF, built to profitability, and exited modestly (read: small f-failure). Formative in every sense. It got me to California, connected me to some great people, taught me a lot about hard things. See: [Moving to America](https://moverell.com/2013/04/2013/04/moving-to-america/), [A Personal Transition](https://moverell.com/2018/04/2018/04/a-personal-transition/). 

**Real Jim Courier (~2012)**

A [parody Twitter account](https://x.com/realjimcourier) I ran with a couple of mates, as a tribute to the greatest tennis commentator of all time. Somehow got traction with a few thousand followers, including a reply from the sitting Australian Prime Minister (also a redhead).

**Australian NBN Project (2009)**

Worked on the National Broadband Network implementation strategy, while at McKinsey. Learned a ton about telco economics and industry structure, and the challenges of implementing big infrastructure policies. Also the first time I realized most of the value lives at the application layer. Since then, I’ve invested my entire career in tech.

**Honours Thesis (2007)**

One of my early career forks. I turned down a grad offer at PwC ($30K package) in Brisbane to do an extra year at uni and bet on something bigger. Wrote my thesis on corporate environmental reporting, had two papers published, and landed a role at McKinsey in Sydney.

**Henry Hiace (2005-2008)**

A 1990 Toyota campervan I drove across Australia with my girlfriend (now wife). We lived on $25 a day, used paper maps, and saw some unforgettable parts of the country. Then sold it for a profit.
