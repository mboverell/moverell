I'm an Australian living in Oakland, California with my wife, two daughters, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1lxcUn9jTGzlR-lZ0sSU3KbXZLjUYTb3i7nw0/" target="_blank">good dog</a>.

I work at [Lyft](http://lyft.com), started [RecruitLoop](http://recruitloop.com), and invest in great companies through [Startmate](http://startmate.com.au). Previously I worked at McKinsey. This site is my personal collection of work, ideas and content. It's work in progress. All opinions my own.

You'll find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mboverell), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/michaeloverell), and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mboverell). Say hi!

Thank for visiting :)
