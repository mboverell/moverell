I'm an Australian living in California with my wife, three daughters, and [good dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1lxcUn9jTGzlR-lZ0sSU3KbXZLjUYTb3i7nw0/).

I build the business at **ClassDojo**. Before that: [Lyft](http://lyft.com), startup founder, consulting. 

I love supporting early-stage founders, and have invested in +20 companiesâ€”mostly in AI, saas, marketplaces. Also started **Antipodes**, a collective of founders and operators that back foreign founders making a dent in the US. If that's you, I'd love to connect.

This is my personal collection of things I'm working on or thinking about. It's all work in progress.

You'll find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mboverell), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/michaeloverell), and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mboverell). Say hi!
