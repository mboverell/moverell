I'm an Australian living in Oakland, California with my wife, two daughters, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1lxcUn9jTGzlR-lZ0sSU3KbXZLjUYTb3i7nw0/" target="_blank">good dog</a>.

I work at [Lyft][1], started [RecruitLoop][2], and invest in great companies through [Startmate](http://startmate.com.au). Previously I worked at McKinsey. This site is my personal collection of work, ideas and content. It's work in progress. All opinions my own.
