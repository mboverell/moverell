I'm an Australian living in California with my wife, three daughters, and [good dog](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1lxcUn9jTGzlR-lZ0sSU3KbXZLjUYTb3i7nw0/).

I'm currently building the business at **[ClassDojo](http://classdojo.com)**. Before that: [Lyft](http://lyft.com), startup founder, consulting. 

I love supporting early-stage founders, and have invested in 20+ companiesâ€”mostly in AI, SaaS, marketplaces. Also started **[Antipodes](http://antipodes.vc)**, a syndicate of founders and operators helping foreign founders break into the US. If that's you, I'd love to connect.

This is my personal collection of things I'm working on or thinking about. It's all work in progress.

You'll find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mboverell), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/michaeloverell), and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/mboverell). Say hi!
